This example demonstrates a common SQL performance issue: using a wildcard character (%) at the beginning of a LIKE clause pattern.  This often leads to a full table scan because indexes cannot be used effectively.  The solution provides an alternative approach that leverages indexing for improved performance. Note: The effectiveness of indexing depends on the specific database system and query structure.
